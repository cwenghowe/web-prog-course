            <p class="newspaper-paragraph"> Local police joined emergency responders in searching for the marine animal without success, and it is understood to have swum back out to sea without being seen.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                While shark-human encounters are not usually a major problem at resort towns in Spain, a few hair-raising incidents have been witnessed over recent years.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                On Friday, footage emerged of another shark, also described as a tintorera, in the water inside Ciutadella Port in Menorca.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                Its early-morning appearance so close to the shoreline sparked speculation it could be injured.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                A video of it gliding through the water coincided with news the shark sighted at Aguamarina Beach had been found dead a couple of miles north.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                A local weather webpage, which posted footage of the tintorera on its side in the sea by rocks close to a strip of sand where people were sunbathing, said: “The seven-foot shark that approached the shoreline has died.”
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                A seagull was filmed standing on top of the shark as the waves lapped over it at La Caleta Beach in Cabo Roig.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                It follows reports that a tiger shark which killed a 23-year-old Russian tourist in Egypt earlier this month is now being embalmed so it can be preserved for a museum display.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                Vladimir Popov was eaten alive while swimming at a popular beach in Hurghada, Egypt, and screamed "Papa, papa" as the shark attacked him in front of horrified onlookers.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                On Wednesday, it was confirmed that the body parts of the man were recovered from inside the shark's belly.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                Amr Zakaria Hamouda, head of the National Institute of Marine Sciences and Fisheries in Egypt, said the animal was mummified and is being prepared for an exhibition in the Museum of Marine Sciences in Hurghada.
