                In a suburban Wellington backyard, there is a scene out of a fantasy novel. Appropriately clad in several kilograms of polished metal armour, three people face off armed with a variety of swords and axes.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                It's just a standard evening for Ben Thomas-Paulson, Dayna Berghan-Whyman and captain Justin Harris - a team of Kiwi knights about to travel overseas to battle it out for our country's honour.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                "This isn't nerdy. This is full force, full contact," Harris told Lion News.

"I've had broken bones, bruises, cut open hands... I had a longsword slip underneath a gauntlet once and shatter one of my fingers into an extra four pieces."
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                He's not speaking lightly when he says "full force". The aim is to knock your opponent to the ground - meaning each swing has power behind it, smashing into the enemy combatant and battering them until they can't fight back.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                The trio of warriors have spent weeks training to prepare for the International Medieval World Championships, persevering through a sweltering New Zealand summer and fighting in thick, padded armour.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                They'll be competing in the polearm, longsword and sword and shield events in the tournament in Scotland.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                "The armour protects you so much. I've been hit in the neck by a three-kilo axe and it knocks you to the ground, but that's it. There's no further damage or injury," Harris said.

"A suit of armour can cost anything between $5000 and $2500."
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                Naturally, there are some complications which come with taking swords and axes overseas.

"I have had issues at Customs," Harris admitted.
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                "Usually you pull it out and show them and they get really interested, and you start talking to them and they run out of time, so they send you through."
                <span class="brmedium"></span>
                Harris admitted the sport may be seen as "kinda odd", but argued it's as legitimate as any other.

"It's a fairly new sport and it's being built up on the international stage," he said.
<span class="brmedium"></span>
"It certainly could be [in the Olympics]. It's a skills-based game using weapons, which basically they've got fencing already - this is just a step up."
<span class="brmedium"></span>
At the competition, Berghan-Whyman is hoping to earn a medal representing New Zealand in the women's polearm and longsword battles. She's one of the few female champions who has competed for New Zealand, in a sport that historically didn't welcome women.
<span class="brmedium"></span>
"We're not going hard out [in training]," she said.
<span class="brmedium"></span>
"The last thing you want to be doing in competition is carrying your arm in a bag!"
<span class="brmedium"></span>
The international competition kicks off on Thursday (local time), with all three of our New Zealand champions set to fight it out against 27 other countries.
