	<h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1>

        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has <br>
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
     </p>

	<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— <i>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"</i>—are marred by an
	indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at
	the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

	<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
	historic events, such as:<br>
      <ul>
	<li> the Cold War</li>
	<li> the civil-rights movement</li>
	<li> the growth of the international drug trade</li>
      
      </p>
