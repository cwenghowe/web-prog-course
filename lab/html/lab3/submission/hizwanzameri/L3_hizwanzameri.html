      <b>LANGLEY, VA</b>—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the
      Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds
      of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black
      highlighters. According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost
      invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by an indelible black ink
      that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret
      highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947. CIA
      Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public
      will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such
      as:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the Cold War
        </li>
        <li>
          the civil-rights movement
        </li>
        <li>
          the growth of the international drug trade
        </li>
      </ul>
