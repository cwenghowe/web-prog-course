    <h1>CIA Realizes It's Been Using Black Highlighters All These Years</h1> <br>

    <p>
        Director Demands Investigation

        Adapted from The Onion

        LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has <br>
        mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
    </p>
    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by <br>
    an <br>
    indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that <br>
    began at <br>
    the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
    
<p>
    CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of <br>
    several <br>
    historic events, such as:

    <ul>
        <li>the Cold War</li>
        <li>
            the civil-rights movement</li>
        <li>
            the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
