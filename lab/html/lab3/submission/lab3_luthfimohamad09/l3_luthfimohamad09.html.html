	<p><b>LANGLEY, VA</b>— A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
    mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

    <p>According to the report, sections of the documents— <i>"almost invariably the most crucial passages"</i> —are marred by an
    indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at
    the agency's inception in 1947.</p>
	
    <p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several
    historic events, such as:</p>
	
    <ol>
    <li>The Cold War</li>
	<li>The civil-rights movement</li>
	<li>The growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ol>
