If you want to learn CSS, it's important to understand the fundamentals of the language, including its syntax, selectors, properties, and values. Here are some of the essential modules in CSS that you should focus on:

1. **Selectors**: The selector is the part of the CSS code that targets the specific element or group of elements that you want to style. There are many different types of selectors in CSS, including class, ID, tag, attribute, and pseudo-class selectors.

2. **Box Model**: The CSS Box Model is an essential concept that defines how an HTML element is displayed on a webpage. It includes the content area, padding, border, and margin.

3. **[Layout](layout-design.md)**: Understanding layout is essential to designing web pages that look good on different devices and screen sizes. CSS has several modules that deal with layout, including Flexbox, Grid, and Float.

4. **Typography**: CSS provides a wide range of typographic properties that can be used to style text, including font-family, font-size, line-height, text-align, and text-decoration.

5. **Responsive design**: With the increasing number of users accessing the web on mobile devices, it's essential to learn how to create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. CSS has several modules that help with responsive design, including Media Queries and Viewport units.

6. **Animations and Transitions**: CSS also provides a range of properties and values that allow you to create animations and transitions, adding interactivity and visual interest to your web pages.
