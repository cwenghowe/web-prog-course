# Grid
Bootstrap's Grid system is a powerful and flexible way to create responsive layouts for websites. The Grid system is based on a 12-column layout, with columns that can be combined and customized to create different layouts for different screen sizes. Here are some key concepts and classes related to the Bootstrap Grid system:

1. **Containers**: Containers are used to create a fixed-width container for content. Containers are defined using the `container` class.

2. **Rows**: Rows are used to group columns together horizontally. Rows are defined using the `row` class.

3. **Columns**: Columns are used to define the width of a section of content. Columns are defined using the `col` class, followed by a number indicating the number of columns the section should occupy. For example, `col-6` would create a section that occupies 6 out of the 12 columns in the row.

4. **Column sizes**: In addition to `col-`, Bootstrap provides a variety of classes to customize column sizes for different screen sizes. These include `col-sm-`, `col-md-`, and `col-lg-`, among others.

5. **Column offsets**: Column offsets can be used to create space between columns. Column offsets are defined using the `offset-` class, followed by a number indicating the number of columns to offset.

By using these classes, developers can create complex and responsive layouts that work across a variety of screen sizes and devices. For example, a developer might create a layout with two columns on a desktop screen (`col-md-6`), but change to a single column layout on a mobile screen (`col-sm-12`).

## Code

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bootstrap Grid Example</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      <h1>Bootstrap Grid Example</h1>
      <p>Resize the browser window to see the effect.</p>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color: lavender">Column 1</div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color: lavenderblush">
          Column 2
        </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4" style="background-color: lavender">Column 3</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.16.0/umd/popper.min.js"></script>
    <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.0/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

In this example, we have included the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files from a CDN, but you can also download and host them locally if you prefer. The `container` class is used to create a fixed-width container that centers the content on the page. Within the container, we have a `row` class that contains three `col-sm-4` classes. This creates a row with three equal-width columns on small and larger screens. We have also added some inline styles to give each column a different background color for demonstration purposes.

When you open this HTML file in a web browser and resize the window, you will see that the columns adjust their widths to maintain the same layout, even on different screen sizes. This is the power of Bootstrap's grid system, which allows developers to create responsive web designs that work well on any device.

In this example, we have created a course registration system for a university. The `container` class is used to create a fixed-width container that centers the content on the page. Within the container, we have a `row` class that contains two `col-lg-4` and `col-lg-8` classes. This creates a row with two columns, one for student information and the other for course information. The `lg` size modifier specifies that the column layout should be applied for large screens and above.

In the left column, we have a form for entering student information, including name and ID. In the right column, we have a table that displays course information, including the course code, title, credit hours, and a checkbox to select the course. We have used the `table` class to create a responsive table that adjusts to the screen size. Finally, we have a `button` to register the selected courses.

By using the grid system, we have created a responsive layout that adjusts to the screen size. The `container` class ensures that the content is centered on the page and the `row` and `col` classes create a flexible layout that adjusts based on the screen size.

Bootstrap's grid system is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts that work on different screen sizes. By using the `container`, `row`, and `col` classes, we can create a flexible and responsive layout that adjusts to the screen size. This is especially important for web applications like the university academic course registration system, which need to work well on different devices and screen sizes.
